DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a fork of Russ Cox's drawterm to incorporate features
from Plan9front (http://9front.org), most importantly DP9IK
authentication support (see authsrv(6)) and the TLS based rcpu(1)
protocol.


INSTALLATION
--------------
To build on Unix, run CONF=unix make.

To build on Solaris using Sun cc, run CONF=sun make.

To build on Windows, you can't use Visual C. Use Mingw on cygwin.

To build on Mac OS X with X11 (xquartz), run CONF=osx-x11 make.

To build on Mac OS X with Cocoa, run CONF=osx-cocoa make and "cp drawterm gui-cocoa/drawterm.app/".

To build for Android, make sure Make.android* files are correct for your build and target systems, then run make -f Make.android

On Android, there is no keyboard support in the app, the bitsy/keyboard on-screen keyboard must be used. From $home/lib/profile:

	if(test -e /mnt/term/root/mnt/sdcard)
		rio -s -k 'bitsy/keyboard -n' -i riostart
	if not
		rio -s -i riostart

The five checkboxes at the top represent the three mouse buttons and mousewheel, determining which "buttons" are clicked.

CAVEATS
--------
Be aware that right now on Android the login details are saved as a plaintext string if saved, and there is no secstore support.
